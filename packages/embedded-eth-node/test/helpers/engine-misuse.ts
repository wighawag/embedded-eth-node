/**
 * engine-misuse.ts: runs in the browser PAGE. Asks the one question a misuse of
 * `exposeNode({createEngine})` used to answer with SILENCE: what does the MAIN
 * THREAD see when a worker module passes something that is not a factory?
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO CATCH IS A NON-EVENT, so it is measured with a
 * budget rather than with a `try`/`catch`. The refusal used to THROW while the
 * worker module was still evaluating, which meant `expose()` never ran, the
 * worker registered no message listener, and `createWorkerNode()` stayed pending
 * FOREVER: no error, no rejection, nothing to catch, and the explanation reaching
 * only the worker's console. `outcome` therefore distinguishes three endings,
 * `REJECTED` (what a caller can act on), `DID_NOT_THROW` (the misuse was
 * accepted) and `NEVER_SETTLED` (the hang), so a regression back to the hang
 * reads as the third rather than as a red timeout with no diagnosis.
 *
 * The SECOND half is the worker's own signal. The main thread's rejection is the
 * late one, by construction: it arrives when somebody asks for a node. The early
 * one is `createNodeWorkerApi()` reporting the mistake at the moment it is made,
 * on the thread that made it, which is what a developer with the worker console
 * open sees first. Both are asserted, because keeping only one of them was the
 * fork this task's steer closed: neither thread should be left guessing.
